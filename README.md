# final-project-portfolio
This is my final-year portfolio project, designed to showcase my skills in web development and software engineering. The project includes sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, and Recommendations, all presented in a responsive and user-friendly interface. It demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications, work with version control using Git and GitHub, and create structured, maintainable code. This portfolio serves as a complete representation of my technical expertise and practical experience gained during my studies.
